# Parsing-Pdf

Here I read the entire pdf using the pdfminer.

I then found the method of idenifying the elements in the entire text so that I could remove the footer from the pdf as we did not need the footer for the NLP task.

I also found a method of identifying the person to whom the IRA tax form belongs to using the pdfminer.
